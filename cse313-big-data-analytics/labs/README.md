# CSE313: Big Data Analytics - Lab Practice: Word Count with MapReduce in Hadoop 

## General Instructions
The purpose of this lab practice is to get you started with Hadoop. Provide a chance for you experience how an analysis task can be done on a computer system using advanced platform and programming model. Here you will learn how to write, compile, debug and execute a simple Hadoop program using MapReduce. There are two parts on this practice. The first part of the practice serves as a tutorial, which will guide you through the whole process of suing Hadoop and the second part will ask you to write your own Hadoop program. Your work will be assessed and it will count as 10% of your final mark.

Section 1 describes the virtual machine environment. Instead of the virtual machine, you are welcome to setup your own pseudo-distributed or fully distributed cluster if you prefer.  Any version of Hadoop that is at least 1.0 will suffice. (For an easy way to set up a cluster, try Cloudera Manager: http://archive.cloudera.com/cm4/installer/latest/cloudera-manager-installer.bin.)  If you choose to setup your own cluster, you are responsible for making sure the cluster is working properly. The TAs will be unable to help you debug configuration issues in your own cluster.

Section 2 gives an example using Eclipse environment in the virtual machine (VM). The example provides an end-to-end example which makes you familiar with the Big Data analytics procedure and framework from creating a project, adding code, and building, running, and debugging it. 

Section 3 is the actual homework assignment.  There is no deliverable for sections 1 and 2. In section 3, you are asked to write and submit your own MapReduce job.

## Submission
Students should submit hard copies of the answers (Section 3) either in class or in the submission box (located on the 4th floor of SD building by the left). For paper submission, please fill the cover sheet and submit it as a front page with your answers. You should also upload your source code and any other files you used.
